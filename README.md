Steps in setting up Django
( Keep in mind that if python -m does not work, try python3 -m)

1. cd to the created folder for this project
2. $ python -m pip install Django (this will create the basic files)
3. If github is already connected, in which this case it is, continue to next step
4. $ python manage.py runserver: will create port in 127.0.0.1:8000/
